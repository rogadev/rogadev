# Hi, I'm Ryan

I am an award-winning business owner turned web developer with a passion for business analysis and designing solutions for small businesses. I graduated at the top of my class in April 2023 from the Web and Mobile Application Development program at Vancouver Island University.

## Current Projects

### CarEvo Logistics Web Application

[CarEvo](https://carevo.ca/), a premier online car dealership based in Dartmouth, NS, Canada, manages an impressive inventory turnover, delivering over 200 vehicles monthly across five eastern provinces. This high volume and geographic spread present distinct logistical challenges. To address these, I am developing a specialized logistics web application tailored to CarEvo's unique requirements. The application provides real-time tracking of vehicles in transit to and from various vendors, lots, and appointments, while also capturing critical information such as cleanliness, tire, battery, and fuel status. Featuring a dedicated vendor portal, it enables seamless updates on vehicle condition, service approvals, parts waiting times, and completion statuses. This solution is designed to streamline CarEvo's operations, ensuring efficiency and satisfaction at every step of the delivery process. I am currently the solo developer on this project.

### CarEvo Customer Web Application

Building upon my collaboration with [CarEvo](https://carevo.ca/), we are introducing a cutting-edge customer web application designed to enhance the ownership experience. This innovative platform assists customers in managing their vehicle expenses and adhering to essential maintenance schedules, such as oil changes, tire rotations, and more. Beyond just a tool for upkeep, the application fosters a unique bond between CarEvo and its clientele. By following tailored maintenance recommendations, customers can secure a higher trade-in value for their vehicles, paving the way for an advantageous upgrade down the road. This strategy not only elevates the customer's experience but also fortifies loyalty to CarEvo, significantly boosting the likelihood of repeat business. The application represents a reciprocal benefit: it deepens customer relationships while simultaneously driving CarEvo's customer retention rates upward.

## Previous Work Experience

During my time at Vancouver Island University (VIU), I not only studied there but also worked as a web developer within the university's web department. I led the development of a [web app](https://career-outlooks.viu.ca) to connect students with real-time, 3-year outlook data for careers related to every credential that VIU has to offer. 

Outside of my work at VIU, I have developed several side-projects that are still in use today, including:
- A [driving app](https://eztripr.com) designed to assist medical companions in transporting dialysis patients across Vancouver Island.
- A [project evaluation tool](https://www.ezeval.app/) for window cleaners, still in use by my previous business and its new owners.

For additional projects, including my new portfolio website, please visit [roga.dev](https://roga.dev) to see updates as they are announced.

## Technical Skills

I'll do my best not to sound too clichÃ©, here, but I really am a passionate full-stack web developer who loves working with JavaScript/TypeScript. On the front-end, I'm a big fan of Vue and Svelte, but I also know React ðŸ˜‰. Each of these has its unique strengths, but lately, Svelte has been my go-to UI framework for its simplicity and elegance - it's truly an unparalleled developer experience.

I have experience working on a variety of web development projects, from full-stack to front-end or back-end specific. I'm also passionate about integrating AI into my projects, like creating a simplified ChatGPT app that lets me talk to my phone to ask simple questions. Currently, I'm working on a new ChatGPT UI project that uses the OpenAI API to create the perfect ChatGPT interface.

When it comes to rendering frameworks, I've really enjoyed working with Astro, Nuxt, and SvelteKit. Astro is my favorite for building websites, but for web apps, I think that Nuxt 3 is really well done. SvelteKit is also fantastic, and I think it has the potential to become my go-to for future side projects once its ecosystem develops a bit more. I'll be eager to test drive 2.0 when it drops.

Overall, I'm a versatile developer who loves to learn and experiment with new technologies. I'm exceptional at analyzing business needs, designing business logic, and crafting solutions that solve problems my clients didn't even realize they had. Whether it's building sleek front-ends or robust back-ends, I'm passionate about crafting high-quality solutions that bring value to users.

## Current Projects

There are several side projects that I've been working on but haven't released yet, including various starter templates for different web frameworks such as SvelteKit and Nuxt 3. I'm also in the process of redesigning the UI/UX of a ChatGPT clone to make it more enjoyable to use than the current ChatGPT user interface. Some additional features I'm implementing include the ability to save, favorite, and pin chat threads for quicker and easier access. Moreover, I'm creating a "seeded template" panel that allows me to prepare my chat threads with a reusable series of prompts. For example, I can upload the latest React documentation to ask a React-related question or seed a thread with dietary restrictions and taste preferences to request recipe ideas based on the ingredients I have in my fridge today.

Lastly, I have 2 long-term projects I'm currently working on. I'm working on transforming my driving assistant into an "Uber of Medical Transport" app, and I'm also rebuilding my VIU Career Outlooks web app as an open API and public web app - this time, enhanced by AI to provide better job results and additional relevant information. If you'd like to support me and my side projects, please consider becoming a GitHub sponsor.

## An Avid AI Advocate, Especially in Education

I am passionate about AI and the ways in which it's about to change our world. I have a TikTok channel called TechnicallyCreative where I talk about AI and how it's about to change our world. I also advocate for teaching tools like ChatGPT in education, especially post-secondary education, instead of trying to outlaw the technology. I strongly believe that if educational institutions decide to treat this technology like the enemy and gatekeep, they are putting their students at a great disadvantage.
