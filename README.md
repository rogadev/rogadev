# Hi, I'm Ryan

I am an award-winning business owner turned web developer with a passion for business analysis and designing solutions for small businesses. I graduated with distinction from VIU's Web and Mobile Application Development program in April 2023.

## Work Experience

Not only did I attend VIU, but I worked there, too. As a web developer with the Vancouver Island University web department, I championed a [web app that helps future students](https://career-outlooks.viu.ca) connect to real-time, 3-year outlook data for every job a given VIU credential might afford you upon graduation. I have also worked on several side projects over the past few years, including developing a [driving app](https://eztripr.com) for medical companions who take dialysis patients to/from appointments all over Vancouver Island, and a [window cleaning project evaluation tool](https://www.ezeval.app/) that is used by my old business and its new ownership. There are plenty of other cool little projects that I'm working on, including a new portfolio website, and you can check out [roga.dev](https://roga.dev) to see those updates as they're announced.

## Technical Skills

I'll do my best not to sound too clichÃ©, here, but I really am a passionate full-stack web developer who loves working with JavaScript/TypeScript. On the front-end, I'm a big fan of Vue and Svelte, but I also know React ðŸ˜‰. Each of these has its unique strengths, but lately, Svelte has been my go-to UI framework for its simplicity and elegance - it's truly an unparalleled developer experience.

I have experience working on a variety of web development projects, from full-stack to front-end or back-end specific. I'm also passionate about integrating AI into my projects, like creating a simplified ChatGPT app that lets me talk to my phone to ask simple questions. Currently, I'm working on a new ChatGPT UI project that uses the OpenAI API to create the perfect ChatGPT interface.

When it comes to rendering frameworks, I've really enjoyed working with Astro, Nuxt, and SvelteKit. Astro is my favorite for building websites, but for web apps, I think that Nuxt 3 is really well done. SvelteKit is also fantastic, and I think it has the potential to become my go-to for future side projects once its ecosystem develops a bit more. I'll be eager to test drive 2.0 when it drops.

Overall, I'm a versatile developer who loves to learn and experiment with new technologies. I'm exceptional at analyzing business needs, designing business logic, and crafting solutions that solve problems my clients didn't even realize they had. Whether it's building sleek front-ends or robust back-ends, I'm passionate about crafting high-quality solutions that bring value to users.

## Current Projects

There are several side projects that I've been working on but haven't released yet, including various starter templates for different web frameworks such as SvelteKit and Nuxt 3. I'm also in the process of redesigning the UI/UX of a ChatGPT clone to make it more enjoyable to use than the current ChatGPT user interface. Some additional features I'm implementing include the ability to save, favorite, and pin chat threads for quicker and easier access. Moreover, I'm creating a "seeded template" panel that allows me to prepare my chat threads with a reusable series of prompts. For example, I can upload the latest React documentation to ask a React-related question or seed a thread with dietary restrictions and taste preferences to request recipe ideas based on the ingredients I have in my fridge today.

Lastly, I have 2 long-term projects I'm currently working on. I'm working on transforming my driving assistant into an "Uber of Medical Transport" app, and I'm also rebuilding my VIU Career Outlooks web app as an open API and public web app - this time, enhanced by AI to provide better job results and additional relevant information. If you'd like to support me and my side projects, please consider becoming a GitHub sponsor.

## An Avid AI Advocate, Especially in Education

I am passionate about AI and the ways in which it's about to change our world. I have a TikTok channel called TechnicallyCreative where I talk about AI and how it's about to change our world. I also advocate for teaching tools like ChatGPT in education, especially post-secondary education, instead of trying to outlaw the technology. I strongly believe that if educational institutions decide to treat this technology like the enemy and gatekeep, they are putting their students at a great disadvantage.
