# Hi, I'm Ryan! üëã

## About Me
üåê I'm a full-stack web developer with an education in web and mobile application development. Having honed my skills through a combination of education and real-world experience, I graduated from Vancouver Island University in 2023, where I excelled academically and professionally. Since graduating, I've worked primarily as a freelancer, developing software solutions that address complex and dynamic business needs. Committed to growth and innovation within a team environment, I am eagerly looking for a full-time position where I can contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals.

üöÄ I specialize in creating dynamic solutions for business operations and logistics management, task automation, customer relationship enhancements, AI integration and educational tools. My projects emphasize functional interfaces, streamlined user experiences, and robust backend architectures.

üîç Currently, I am seeking a full-time position where I can bring my innovative approach to a collaborative team, working on impactful projects.
