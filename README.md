The VIU Career Outlooks Web Application represents a pivotal collaboration between myself and Vancouver Island University, conceived during my 2022 summer internship as part of the ITAS Web and Mobile Development Diploma program. Aimed at aiding prospective students in making informed decisions regarding their educational and professional paths, this innovative tool seamlessly connects VIU programs and credentials with real-world employment opportunities. By integrating data scraping techniques and database management with Prisma, I ensured the accuracy and relevance of employment outlooks presented to users. Currently live on VIU's website, the application provides detailed insights into career pathways, job prospects, and industry trends across British Columbia. As I continue to evolve this project, I'm enhancing its functionality with features such as user authentication and personalized price sheets, while transitioning to modern technologies like Nuxt, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for improved performance and usability.

As a part of my ITAS268 Final Project, I created the Victoria MossAway Portfolio using Astro, a modern frontend framework. Departing from traditional CMS platforms like Drupal or WordPress, I crafted a custom CMS solution tailored to my needs. Leveraging AI technology, I generated unique moss monster images and optimized text to enhance SEO and engage visitors effectively. Despite its short-lived duration due to the sale of MossAway, this portfolio site proved highly effective, ranking organically on Google and competently representing my work without conflicting with the SEO of the original MossAway site.

With a click, users can save their generated password to the clipboard for convenience. Leveraging Vue.js for frontend functionality and TypeScript for robust type-checking, the RogaDev Password Generator demonstrates my proficiency in crafting responsive and visually appealing interfaces. Despite its simplicity, this project underscores my commitment to delivering effective solutions that meet user needs in a straightforward manner.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

Initially developed during my first year of school, the Window Cleaning Project Evaluation Tool originated from a need within my previous business, which specialized in exterior cleaning services. Faced with the challenge of generating accurate window cleaning quotes efficiently, I identified a gap in available tools and decided to create a solution myself. Leveraging vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a mobile-friendly application that prioritized simplicity, speed, and effectiveness. This initial version proved highly successful in streamlining the quotation process. Currently, I'm actively enhancing the tool for a future version. This new iteration incorporates advanced features such as user authentication, personalized price sheets with save functionality, and a complete rewrite using modern technologies including Nuxt, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Through this ongoing development, I aim to further improve the tool's functionality and usability, catering to the evolving needs of window cleaning professionals.
