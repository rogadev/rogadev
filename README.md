# Hi, I'm Ryan

I am an award-winning business owner turned web developer with a passion for business analysis and designing solutions for small businesses. I graduated with distinction from VIU's Web and Mobile Application Development program in April 2023.

## Work Experience

I have gained valuable work experience by working for VIU's web department, where I championed and solo-developed a web app that helps connect future students to the 3-year outlook of jobs that each credential that VIU offers can afford you upon graduation. I have also worked on several side projects while going to school, including developing a driving app for medical companions who take dialysis patients to/from appointments all over Vancouver Island, and a window cleaning project evaluation tool that is used by my old business and its new ownership.

## Technical Skills

I love working with JavaScript and TypeScript, and I have experience working on full-stack web development projects, as well as front-end or back-end specific development. I have also been integrating AI into several of my projects, including creating a simplified ChatGPT app that allows me to talk to my phone to ask simple questions. I am currently working on a new ChatGPT UI project, using the OpenAI API to create the ChatGPT interface that I want.

## Moving to Halifax, NS, Canada

I currently live in Nanaimo, BC, Canada, but I will be moving to Halifax, NS, Canada in a few weeks (June 1st). I am looking for office work if it's in Halifax or remote work in Canada, US, and beyond. I am also very interested in finding work opportunities abroad, so if the employer is offering to pay to move me to another country, I would consider it.

## Advocacy for AI Education

I am passionate about AI and the ways in which it's about to change our world. I have a TikTok channel called TechnicallyCreative where I talk about AI and how it's about to change our world. I also advocate for teaching tools like ChatGPT in education, especially post-secondary education, instead of trying to outlaw the technology. I strongly believe that if educational institutions decide to treat this technology like the enemy and gatekeep, they are putting their students at a great disadvantage.
