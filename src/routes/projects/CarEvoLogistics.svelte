						For CarEvo Auto Solutions, I introduced a tailored web application to modernize their
						vehicle management processes, replacing manual spreadsheet tracking with a more scalable
						and efficient digital approach. This web tool enables streamlined tracking of vehicles
						from inventory to customer delivery, boasting features such as a QR-coded key tag system
						for swift vehicle lookup to enhance operational speed and accuracy.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-8">
						Functionally, the application serves as a comprehensive platform for managing service
						appointments, lot moves, task prioritization, and vendor interactions, leveraging
						intuitive visualization to streamline workflow management and prioritize urgent tasks
						effectively. Outside of the regular user dashboard, a portal was designed to grant
						vendors the ability to engage with the digital workflow of vehicles on their journey
						through service appointments, enabling real-time service updates, improving
						communication, and reducing errors in task coordination.
					</p>

						The adoption of this web application has resulted in tangible benefits for CarEvo,
						enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costly errors. By automating critical
						processes and centralizing data, the web app empowers CarEvo to efficiently manage
						inventory, tasks, and various vendor interactions. This leads to smoother communication,
						improved workflow efficiency, and ultimately better overall service delivery.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-8">
						The development of this web application involved a combination of technical skills and
						business analysis expertise. Leveraging technologies such as Nuxt, Vue, Tailwind, and
						TypeScript, the application delivers a modern, user-friendly, fully-responsive user
						experience. This project showcases proficiency in frontend and backend development,
						database management, and user interface design, highlighting the developer's ability to
						deliver scalable, practical solutions for complex business challenges on a fixed
						timeline.
