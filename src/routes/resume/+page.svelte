				Enthusiastic full-stack web developer proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript and a variety of
				web frameworks such as Node/Express, Vue, Svelte, React, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Astro. My
				forte lies in crafting innovative web solutions, marrying business needs with efficient web
				applications, demonstrated by my capstone project and several projects I created to support
				my own small business. My keen interest in AI and machine learning led me to incorporate
				OpenAI's API into my capstone project, EzTripr, a medical transport driving app that
				streamlines schedules and enhances communication with passengers and dispatch.

				As an award-winning business owner, I am skilled in analyzing business needs and creating
				web applications that increase productivity and enhance the customer journey. My solid
				background in team management, coupled with a deep understanding for how commitment to
				customer satisfaction can shape unique and successful brands, equips me with a distinctive
				skill set that you won't find in any other candidate.

				Eager to advance in a full-time web development role, I invite you to review my work on
				<a href="https://github.com/rogadev/capstone">GitHub</a>. Flexible for on-site, hybrid, or
				remote arrangements, I'm prepared to contribute to your team starting immediately.
