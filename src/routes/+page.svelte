			<p>
				I am a highly motivated full-stack web developer with a passion for TypeScript and AI. With
				proficiency in Vue, Svelte, Node/Express, SvelteKit, Nuxt, and more, I have a proven track
				record of creating innovative web solutions that improve the lives of customers and
				employees. My capstone project, a medical transport driving app called EzTripr,
				revolutionizes trip management for drivers by streamlining schedules and enhancing
				communication with passengers and dispatch. Built using Nuxt 3 and TypeScript, I
				incorporated OpenAI's API to enhance the usability of the app. As an award-winning business
				owner, I am skilled in analyzing business needs and creating web applications that increase
				productivity and enhance the customer journey. With a strong background in team management
				and a keen eye for detail, I excel at keeping customers happy and creating amazing brands. I
				am excited to bring my expertise to a full-time web development role and continue to grow as
				a developer. Please feel free to check out my GitHub readme
				(https://github.com/rogadev/capstone) for more details on my capstone project and other work
				examples.
